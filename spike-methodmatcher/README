Modified version of MethodMatcher code from
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4188919/how-to-search-for-java-api-methods-by-type-signature

Modifications:
 - import statements to get it to compile
 - excluded inner classes (with '$' in their name) from search, to avoid exception in Class.getByName

 - takes rt.jar as cmdline argument

To run on Mac:
  $ /usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8 --exec javac MethodMatcher.java
  $ /usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8 --exec java MethodMatcher `/usr/libexec/java_home -v 1.8`/jre/lib/rt.jar

Note: requires a JAR to search, so doesn't work directly with modules (Java 9+).
